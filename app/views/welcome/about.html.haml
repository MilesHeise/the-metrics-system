  .panel-heading How to use this metric tracking service:

%p First, register the URL of an app you want to track.

%p Add this Javascript somewhere central to your app |
(e.g. the application.js file in a Rails app): |

%pre
  :preserve
    var metricsSystem = {};
    metricsSystem.report = function(eventName) {
      var event = {
        event: {
          name: eventName
        }
      };
      var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      request.open("POST", "http://localhost:3000/api/events", true);
      request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
      request.send(JSON.stringify(event));
    }

%p Now, just attach it to places where you want reports. |
You could put it in a script tag to report on page loads, |
for instance, or add "onclick: "metricsSystem.report('New Post Created')" |
to a submit button to track when posts are submitted. |
-#
%p The Metrics System is type-agnostic, it doesn't care what your |
events are and you can name them anything you like. The Javascript |
is basic native AJAX so you don't need JQuery in your app for it to work. |
